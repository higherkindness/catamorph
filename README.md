# compendium

## What is compendium?
compendium is a standalone solution, implemented as an HTTP service, that provides storage, conversion and client generation for your schemas in a format-agnostic fashion.

## Features and comparison with Schema Registry

|Conversion between formats       |yes        |no             |
|Client code generation           |yes        |no             |

Pluggable storage backends means that you can use whatever storage fits your needs, being filesystem and PostgreSQL the current out of the box backends provided by compendium.

Format-agnostic ensures that you can use any of the most popular schema formats, ranging from binaries like Avro and Protocol Buffers, to more web related like OpenAPI, in a transparent manner.

Conversion between formats saves a ton of work trying to manually adapt schemas that you are already using, while retaining type safety and ensuring formats compatibility.

Finally, code generation (Scala) is a very interesting feature that allows putting into use all those stored schemas without worrying about their future changes and evolutions.
